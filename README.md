## 💫 About Me

🎯 I’m currently working on:  
Designing scalable machine learning pipelines, optimizing retention strategies, and developing simulation-based tools for smarter business decisions.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:  
Data science and analytics projects, especially those involving ML/NLP, optimization, or business intelligence. Always up for Python, SQL, or cloud-powered solutions (Snowflake, AWS, GCP)!

🖐️ I’m looking for help with:  
Advanced experimentation techniques and causal inference modeling to derive deeper, explainable insights.

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
Applications of deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, personalization, and business forecasting.

💬 Ask me about:  
Churn prediction, A/B testing, growth analytics, customer segmentation, dashboarding, or designing data solutions for real-world impact.

⚡ Fun fact:  
🏆 I secured 1st place in a Purdue-hosted Airbnb retention competition by building an ML-powered incentive allocation model using Random Forest with 81% ROC-AUC.
🏆 I secured 1st place in a Kaggle bankruptcy prediction competition, where my team developed a high-accuracy ensemble model integrating advanced machine learning techniques!
